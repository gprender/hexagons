# hexagons

This is me learning how to use OpenGL! My end goal is to be able to render a "game board" of interlocking hexagonal tiles.

I'm starting off by following a tutorial series by Andrew Mengede, which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn3eTxaOtL2PHxN8EHf-ktAcN-sGETKfw). The tutorials are a great balance of detail and approachability, so I'd recommend giving them a watch!
